arduino_connection
=====================
This module manages the connections with the arduino so we can do all the interaction
needed in order to perform the functionality of the terrarium to do it smart.

This module contains the following classes:
    - ArduinoConnection: This class manages the connection with the arduino and the-
    communication with the same arduino.

This module contains the following methods:
    - get_arduino_ports: This method detects the serial ports in use and if there are
    more than one the program will use the first serial-port available to be used.
    - init_connection: This method inits the connection to the Arduino more specifically
    for checking is there's an Arduino available for been used in to the app.
    - read_arduino: This method is used for reading the data that comes from the Arduino
    in order to be showed in the raspberry app to the user.
    - write_arduino: This method is for sending the instructions to the Arduino, so the
    Arduino will know what to do with the rest of the components installed in the terrarrium.
    - clean_shell: This method is for cleaning the shell of the app according to the OS.
    - close_connection: Just for closing the connection with the Arduino.
    - start_communication: Inits the communication with the Arduino to start the main
    functionality of the same Arduino.
    - communication: The method that do the stream of the temperatures, humidity and all
    data that comes from the Arduino and also send the instructions to the arduino to do things.
