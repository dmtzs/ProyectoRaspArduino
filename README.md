# Instructions

## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to manage the parameters of my pet that is a snake.
<br>
The data that will be processed is going to be the temperature and humidity with a dht22 sensor, the water level in his container and an automatic system for spreading water in order to humidify the terrarium every time the humidity is over 50%.
<br>
Also the water will be warm with another sensor for keep warm the reserve of water.
<br><br>

## Rasp Berry python program
The user interface will be developed with python using electron with flask microframework for the graphic interface in order to show all the data we need with an interface which is builded with css.
<br>
The program will process the data that comes from the arduino via USB and the python program will be processing this data.
All this in order to be showed through a display connected to the raspberry.
<br>

### Installation, libraries and considerations
* For its correct installation and use you need first python3 the version 3 or higher.
* The project uses Ubuntu mate OS for the raspberry.
* The model of the raspberry is pi4 B+.
* USB cable for connect both boards between them.
* Use pip3 install -r requirements.txt in order to install all python libraries needed.
<br><br>
